abstract = {In a previous paper we introduced a distribution-based method for Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA), called PAWN, which uses cumulative distribution functions of model outputs to assess their sensitivity to the model's uncertain input factors. Over the last three years, PAWN has been employed in the environmental modelling field as a useful alternative or complement to more established variance-based methods. However, a major limitation of PAWN up to now was the need for a tailored sampling strategy to approximate the sensitivity indices. Furthermore, this strategy required three tuning parameters whose optimal choice was rather unclear. In this paper, we present an alternative approximation procedure that tackles both issues and makes PAWN applicable to a generic sample of inputs and outputs while requiring only one tuning parameter. The new implementation therefore allows the user to estimate PAWN indices as complementary metrics in multi-method GSA applications without additional computational cost.},

@article{KhorashadiZadeh2017,
abstract = {Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is an essential technique to support the calibration of environmental models by identifying the influential parameters (screening) and ranking them. In this paper, the widely-used variance-based method (Sobol') and the recently proposed moment-independent PAWN method for GSA are applied to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and compared in terms of ranking and screening results of 26 SWAT parameters. In order to set a threshold for parameter screening, we propose the use of a “dummy parameter”, which has no influence on the model output. The sensitivity index of the dummy parameter is calculated from sampled data, without changing the model equations. We find that Sobol' and PAWN identify the same 12 influential parameters but rank them differently, and discuss how this result may be related to the limitations of the Sobol' method when the output distribution is asymmetric.},
